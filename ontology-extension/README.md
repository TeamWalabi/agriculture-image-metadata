# Ontology extension

This folder contains **minimal project-specific extensions** used when no suitable term exists in an external ontology.

- `agriculture-image-extension.ttl`: local classes/properties referenced by the application profile and shapes

## Guiding principle

- Prefer **existing ontologies** first (e.g., DCAT/DCTERMS, SOSA/SSN, PROV-O, schema.org, EXIF, QUDT).
- Add terms here only for **gaps** (project-required fields without a stable external equivalent).
