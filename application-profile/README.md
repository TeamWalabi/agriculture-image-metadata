# Application profile

This folder contains the **application profile** for the Agriculture Image Metadata model.

- `metadata-profile.xlsx`: working spreadsheet (authoring format)
- `metadata-profile.ttl`: RDF/Turtle representation (for reuse and tooling)

## Notes

- The RDF/Turtle file is intended to be aligned with the spreadsheet.
- If you add new terms, prefer referencing existing vocabularies first; only add minimal local extensions where needed.
